Overview- This project explores inpatient hospital data to identify meaningful patterns and trends. Using statistical analysis and visualizations, it provides insights into patient demographics, admission types, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization. The goal is to demonstrate how raw healthcare data can be transformed into actionable information for decision-making and operational improvement.

Objectives- 
Clean, prepare, and analyze real-world healthcare data.
Apply statistical techniques to identify trends and correlations.
Build visual dashboards for intuitive understanding.
Derive insights to optimize hospital resource allocation and patient care.

Tech Stack and Tools- 
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics, correlations, trend analysis
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Key Steps- 
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding, and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions, outliers, and relationships.
Statistical Insights: Applying summary statistics and hypothesis testing.
Visualization: Creating clear plots and dashboards to communicate findings.

Sample Insights-
Identified top admission types and their frequency.
Found patterns in patient age groups vs. treatment outcomes.
Highlighted seasonal or time-based admission trends.

How to Use-
Clone the repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Power BI files.
Follow the step-by-step analysis to reproduce results.

Future Scope-
Integrating predictive analytics for patient outcomes.
Expanding dataset for multi-hospital comparison.
Building an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring.
